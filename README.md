# React + TypeScript + Vite
This is an example of how how you can implement microfront architecture in a monorepo
using react and - [@vite-plugin-federation]([https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@originjs/vite-plugin-federation))
which support Module Federation. Inspired by Webpack and compatible with Webpack Module Federation.
